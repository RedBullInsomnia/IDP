  This library contain several method to simplify the main code of the arduinowhich must be modulable.
  you can easyly control different zone with the same arduino because the zone of the arduino is asked at every request that make the arduino completly compatible with other technology than wifi if we use the same information packaging.
  ////////////////////////////////////Packaging information//////////////////////
  Super user / Action: 
        the information must be a special string from this list:
                -jour   : turn the light on.
                -nuit   : turn the light off.
                -harlem : turn the light on than off on a special frequency which getting lower as the light blink.
                -blink  : turn the light on if it's off and off if it's on. If you let this command for a while, you are going to have the frequency of refreshing of your code.
  analyse:
        this method will analyse the zone the two different zone and will turn on the ligh if the two zones match. the zone of the arduino must be an int but the zone of the order is a string (easyly to get it but the code is modulable). The order is a string wich contain an int between 0 and 100 (we can put higher but won't produce it).
